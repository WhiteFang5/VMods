* (Locally hosted games only) Install [ServerLaunchFix](https://v-rising.thunderstore.io/package/Mythic/ServerLaunchFix/)
* Extract the Vmods._mod-name_.dll
* Move the desired mod(s) to the `[VRising (server) folder]/BepInEx/WetstonePlugins/`
* Launch the server (or game) to auto-generate the config files
* Edit the configs as you desire (found in `[VRising (server) folder]/BepInEx/config/`)

  * If this doesn't work, or isn't enabled, restart the server/game

## Commands
Most of the VMods come with a set of commands that can be used. To see the available commands, by default a player or admin can use `!help`.  
Normal players won't see the Admin-only commands listed.  
The prefix (`!`) can be changed on a per-mod basis.  
To prevent spam/abuse there's also a command cooldown for non-admins, this value can also be tweaked on a per-mod basis.  
Commands can also be disabled completely on a per-mod basis.
